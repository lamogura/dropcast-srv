I only finally took the plunge when writing <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>, and it turned my eating and my life into high definition. <a href=\"http://foodistkitchen.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">Foodist Kitchen</a> is a 30-day program that teaches you how to cook without recipes, and I highly recommend it. Chopping and saut\u00e9ing are just a small part of the whole deal -- you also need to know what flavors taste good together and what it means to cook until done.</p> <p><a href=\"http://foodistkitchen.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">Foodist Kitchen</a> brings all these skills together so you can walk into the kitchen, open the fridge, and have an intuitive sense of what to cook and how to do it. It was created by Darya Rose, who's a friend of mine and one of my cooking mentors for <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>. She has offered a $15 discount off your membership, so check out <a href=\"http://foodistkitchen.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">FoodistKitchen.com/Tim</a> to learn more about the program.</p> <p><strong>This episode is also brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.exoprotein.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">Exo Protein</a>.</strong> These guys are making protein bars using cricket protein powder. Before you screw your face up and look disgusted, I bet they taste better than any protein bar you've ever had before! With recipes that were developed by a three-Michelin-starred chef, the bars are paleo-friendly, with no gluten, no grains, no soy, no dairy, etc., and they won't pop up your glycemic response. In fact, they're less processed than any other protein bars you'll be able to find.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.exoprotein.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">Exo Protein</a> is offering a deep discount to Tim Ferriss Show listeners -- if you go to <a href=\"https://www.exoprotein.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">ExoProtein.com/Tim today</a>, you can try a sampler pack with all of the most popular flavors for less than $10. This is a startup with limited inventory that sells out all the time, so <a href=\"https://www.exoprotein.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">act fast</a>!</p>",

   "description": "<p>This is\u00a0another special episode of <em>The Tim Ferriss Show.</em>\u00a0Usually, when I talk about strategies for living a better life, I focus on strategies for effectiveness and efficiency. That is, finding ways for you to be better without wasting time. Both of these are important, but fine-tuning those traits come naturally for me. Mindfulness is something that is difficult and usually overlooked by most people.</p> <p>So why is\u00a0mindfulness essential? When it comes to achievement, most people just work harder. In reality, you want to first achieve more focus and clarity, which can help guide your effort. This is the real benefit of mindfulness. Once you incorporate it into your life, you complain less, appreciate more, react less, and fill your life with what's most important to you. More than anything, you'll learn how to be present and live in the moment.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast\">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p><strong>This podcast is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://99designs.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">99Designs</a>,</strong> <strong>the world\u2019s largest marketplace of graphic designers</strong>.\u00a0I have used them for years to create some amazing designs.

Much more interesting to me, Richard passed the Court of Master Sommeliers' Masters Exam on his first attempt, becoming the ninth person in history ever to do so.</p> <p>I first met Richard through <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/05/30/chris-sacca/\" target=\"_blank\">investing wunderkind Chris Sacca</a>, and we immediately hit it off. Richard can help you train your senses for anything, including wine, whiskey, his current love of mezcal, and far beyond.</p> <p>He's also done a lot of wild experiments, got a lot of tattoos, almost been shot in Mexico, and developed an incredible ability to simplify the complex. We get along.</p> <p>In this conversation, we talk about nearly everything, ranging from the value of quitting to tricks of the trade, travel tips (he's traveling 300+ days per year), and \"starter\" wines.</p> <p>We also drink a boat-load of whiskey, me tasting and Richard teaching. The pictures below show\u00a0a sample. Side note and cool rule of thumb: did you know it's spelled \"whiskey\" when from countries that have \"e\" in their names (e.g. America) but \"whisky\" when from countries that don't have an \"e\" in their names (e.g. Scotland, Japan)? Richard taught me that.</p> <p>Last but not least, Richard is the author of a brand-new book, \u201c<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1LQjznx\" target=\"_blank\">The Essential Scratch & Sniff Guide to Becoming a Whiskey Know-It-All</a>,\u201d which is sitting on my kitchen table with whiskey stains all over it. It distils (see what I did there?) a couple of lifetimes worth of study down to 24 pages...then makes them smell good. <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1LQjznx\" target=\"_blank\">Definitely check it out</a>. At the very least, it gives you a bunch of rules of thumb (like the <em>whiskey</em> vs. <em>whisky</em> trick), so you can impress your friends and not look like a dumb-ass at the bar. Sweet! Less dumb-ass and more smart-ass is always good. Get 'er done.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast\">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p><strong>This podcast is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://meundies.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">MeUndies</a>.\u00a0</strong>If I\u2019m not going commando, then I\u2019m wearing MeUndies.

He is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert who used to tap out 20 Navy SEALs per workout. He is a legend in the Special Operations world. His eyes look <em>through</em> you more than <em>at</em> you.</p> <p>He rarely does interviews, if ever. But a few weeks ago, Jocko ended up staying at my house and we had a caffeinated mind meld. Here's some background...</p> <p>Jocko enlisted in the Navy after high school and spent 20 years in the SEAL Teams, first as an enlisted SEAL operator and then as a SEAL officer. During his second tour in Iraq, he led SEAL Task Unit Bruiser in the Battle of Ramadi--some of the toughest and sustained combat in the SEAL Teams since Vietnam.</p> <p>Under his leadership, Task Unit Bruiser became the most highly decorated Special Operations Unit of the entire war in Iraq and helped bring stability to Ramadi. Jocko was awarded the Bronze Star and a Silver Star.</p> <p>Upon returning to the United States, Jocko served as the Officer-in-Charge of training for all West Coast SEAL Teams, designing and implementing some of the most challenging and realistic combat training in the world.</p> <p>So why is Jocko opening up? Well, in part, we have mutual friends. Second, he is the co-author of an incredible new book \u2014 <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1MHS9l3\" target=\"_blank\">Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win</a> -- which I've been loving.

He is the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594774021/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594774021&linkCode=as2&tag=offsitoftimfe-20&linkId=DWNDSZVYE5HZE7ZM\">The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide</a>.<br /><br />Called \u201cAmerica\u2019s wisest and most respected authority on psychedelics and their use,\u201d Jim Fadiman has been involved with psychedelic research since the 1960s. In this episode, we discuss the\u00a0immediate and long-term effects of psychedelics when used for spiritual purposes (high dose), therapeutic purposes (moderate dose), and problem-solving purposes (low dose). Fadiman outlines best practices for safe \"entheogenic\" voyages learned through his more than 40 years of experience--from the benefits of having a sensitive guide during a session (and how to be one) to the importance of the setting and pre-session intention. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">We also discuss new uses for LSD and other psychedelics, including extremely low doses for improved cognitive function. Cautioning that psychedelics are not for everyone, he dispels the myths and misperceptions about psychedelics, which are commonly circulated in textbooks. Fadiman explain\u00a0how -- in his opinion -- psychedelics, used properly, can lead not only to healing but also to scientific breakthroughs and spiritual epiphanies.<br /><br />Show notes and links for this episode can be found at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast\">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a></span></p>",

I read very few blogs regularly, but BrainPickings is one of the few. \u00a0It is a treasure trove.<br /><br />BrainPickings is Maria's one-woman labor of love \u2014 her subjective lens on what matters in the world and why. It's also an inquiry into how to live and what it means to lead a good life. \u00a0From Mark Twain to Oscar Wilde and everyone in between, Maria finds hidden gems to share.<br /><br />And that's what I hoped to do in this episode. \u00a0It takes me a few minutes to warm up in this interview, but as soon as we get going, we geek out like crazy, talking about almost every aspect of her life, her site, her business, and her writing.</p> <p>I loved doing this interview, and I hope you love listening to it. \u00a0There are a lot of valuable nuggets.</p>",

This episode is DEEP in the best way possible. \u00a0And for a change from Episode 1, I'm totally sober.</span></p>",
