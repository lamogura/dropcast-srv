The revolution in Price's music is that he described his life as it actually was, resisting the urge to inflate his own ego or polish his circumstance to make for a slicker image. From there, Robin has two songs that contain an album of material each, Katie has an activist punk time capsule and a shiny, groovy treat from Brooklyn, and Timm has some sly R&B from a singer trying to pass his heartache off as automotive nostalgia.",

We asked Tempest to be our guest DJ on this week's episode of All Songs Considered to find out the story behind her stories. Unsurprisingly, the songs by other musicians that she chose to play point feature sharp, contemplative lyrics and artists who have never compromised their work in the name of popularity or commercial success.

It's also an eight-part documentary currently running on HBO. Together, the album and film series look at the intersection of geography and music. It's what Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl calls a love letter to the history of American music. The band wrote and recorded each song in a different city. Grohl interviewed local musical icons in each place and wove the stories he heard and the history of each location into his lyrics. The first stop in the band's musical journey was Chicago, followed by Grohl's former hometown, Washington, D.C., then on to Nashville, Austin, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Seattle and New York. When Dave Grohl stopped by the NPR studios in Washington, D.C. to talk about Sonic Highways with us, he reflected on growing up in the area, on what it was like to see his favorite bands play the 9:30 Club and how the city's complicated and controversial history shaped his world view and the song \"The Feast and the Famine,\" which was recorded at Inner Ear Studio in the D.C. area. Grohl also explained how some of the other songs for Sonic Highways came together and talked about the local musicians that inspired them.",

Ferry was 26 years old when the group formed in 1971, but his unexpectedly mature croon was a potent counterpoint to the glam and eerie electronic rock the group made. Later, as a solo artist, Ferry found entry points to cover both '60s rock hits and standards from the 1930s. His music has been a combination of all those things ever since. Bryan Ferry is now 69 years old. His voice is a bit deeper and even more alluring. His latest (and fourteenth) solo album, Avonmore, comes out Nov. 18. He recently sat down to chat about the record and his life of music with All Songs Considered hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton. Speaking from member station WNYC in New York, Ferry talked about his love for sad music, why he'd like to see his songs turned into a Broadway musical and how he was inspired to become a musician after hitchhiking to London to see Otis Redding play.",

Four of those songs are on the show this week, including an upbeat but dark song from the British trio Happyness, a grinding track from post-punk band Protomartyr, Japanese prog and punk rock from Bo Ningen and gorgeous vocals and instrumental harmonies from teenage Norwegian singer-songwriter Aurora. Robin also shares a gorgeous, spare song from Grouper (Liz Harris), whose forthcoming album, Ruins, is available to stream in its entirety in our First Listen series. And finally, it's difficult to believe that it's been more than a year since Lou Reed's death. A new reissue of The Velvet Underground's self-titled third album is packaged in a six-disc box set that includes previously unheard live recordings and a newly remastered version of the album.

This conversation with John Congleton is as much a philosophical look at life and appreciating sound as it is a geeky look at what a producer does. In a long conversation that touches on his work with some of the musicians listed above, Congleton shared his own mantra as a producer and listener, which was inspired by the example of one of his heroes, the late, great BBC radio DJ, music journalist and taste maker John Peel: \"Any time he ever hears a piece of music that he doesn't like, he just assumes it's his problem.\" It's a great philosophy that takes music listening and criticism beyond the judgmental, number-driven rating system that often defines it. Near the start of the conversation, John Congleton said, \"Art that doesn't challenge [me] is not interesting to me. I'm intoxicated by the stuff that I don't understand, 'cause at the end of the day I \u2014 if I get something out of that, I'm a better producer, I'm a better listener, I'm a better everything.\" Amen!

Bob Boilen introduces Italian electronic band Niagara with a driving track from the band's sophomore album, Don't Take It Personally, released last week. Next, Robin offers a killer song from Cleveland based mr. Gnome, whose new album, The Heart of a Dark Star, he has been eagerly awaiting since hearing their set at SXSW in 2011. Following a raw, unsettling song from Neuroplasticity, a left-turn of a sophomore album by the artist Cold Specks, editor Jacob Ganz makes a guest appearance to discuss an old favorite: '90s slowcore band Bedhead. The band is reissuing its complete recordings in a box set titled Bedhead 1992-1998, which features a previously unreleased cover of The Stranglers' classic, \"Golden Brown\" that's about as energetic as the subdued Texas band ever got. We close the episode with a track from Philip Selway's excellent solo album Weatherhouse, which, unlike side projects from Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, sounds distinctly un-Radiohead-like.",

Later in the show, Bob shares GOAT's \"Hide From The Sun\" before Robin plays new music from the full-throttle, jangly, punk rock trio Spider Bags. Bob closes out the show with Zola Jesus' \"Dangerous Days,\" a high-powered dance-rock tune that gives him the energy needed to pick up his suitcase and get home for some much-needed sleep. If you want to hear more from the Newport Folk Festival, we've got sets from Jenny Lewis, Jeff Tweedy and lots more at our Newport Folk hub.",

Next, Robin premieres \"Small Window,\" a gorgeously understated track from the folk duo Luluc. Later in the show Bob and Robin put in a call to NPR Music's Anastasia Tsioulcas and Frannie Kelley in New York City to play some of their favorite songs of the first half of the year; Anastasia chooses the Belgian chameleon Stromae (whose name is an inversion of the word \"Maestro\"), playing 'Ave Cesaria' from his recent release Racine Carr\u00e9e. Frannie opts for 'Broken,' a cut from Pi\u00f1ata, the collaboration between the raw-voiced rapper Freddie Gibbs and the meticulous DJ and producer Madlib. Later, Bob and Robin also lure NPR Music's Lars Gotrich away from his desk and into the studio to shine some light on the state of metal in 2014: Lars plays 'I Will Run,' a melodic hard-rocker from Chicago's High Spirits. Robin wraps things up with White Fence's 'Like That,' the first tune we've heard from the California garage-rockers upcoming record For the Recently Found Innocent. With its catchy chorus and falsetto vocals, it takes Robin to a place of peace, and if only for a brief moment, he forgets whatever dirty diapers await him at home.",

This time around, the men and women are often part of the same band. \u00a0 Jack White has been a passionate and gritty guitar player since he was a teenager, and with The White Stripes he excelled at making music that was bold and brash. But in his many projects, both as a musician and as the mind behind the Nashville label Third Man Records, he's demonstrated a love for a range of American styles, and found ways to bring music from the hills and from the distant past into the here and now. On Lazaretto, he puts those influences on full view: old-time fiddle, honky-tonk piano, wailing electronics and his own shimmering guitar. \u00a0 When I spoke with Jack White last week, I was in Philadelphia and he was in Nashville, in rehearsals with his band to tour the new record this summer. We talked about the composition process behind the new album \u2014 including how he crushed writer's block with a little help from his 19-year-old self \u2014 as well as the nature of fate and coincidence, and why he rarely writes anything down.

Sturgill Simpson's \"Turtles All The Way Down\" is a strange and transfixing ode to other dimensions, space, time, reptile alien autopsies and other curiosities in his endless search for meaning in the universe.

This Saturday, Apr. 19, is the day when masses of music lovers wait in long lines at local independent records stores, hoping to score exclusive releases on vinyl. To mark the occasion, hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton share six Record Store Day exclusives, starting with a cut by Bruce Springsteen, from an EP he's releasing called American Beauty. The 12\" EP features four unreleased, never-heard songs from The Boss. Three were recorded during sessions for his High Hopes LP. The fourth, and one we've got, is an earlier, electrified cut called \"Hurry Up Sundown.\" Bob follows with a live recording of Devo made during a 1977 concert at Max's Kansas City. The song, \"Uncontrollable Urge,\" shows the punchier side to the band's sound. One of those very music fans who waits in line on Record Store Day, Ben Kessler, shares his meticulously planned list of \"needs\" and \"wants,\" and explains his unbridled spending habits this time of year. On his list: A live recording from 1991 of The Pogues with Joe Strummer of The Clash (who had temporarily replaced singer Shane MacGowan in the band) on vocals, including \"If I Could Fall From Grace With God.\" Ben then shifts gears and unearths his love for Ke$ha and Lydia Loveless. Loveless is releasing a 7\" single with a new original song backed by a surprising cover of Ke$ha's \"Blind.\" We close the show out with a strangely textured Dana Falconberry song produced by Spoon drummer Jim Eno, and \"Always N Forever\" by Chicago's brash, young rock group The Orwells. Merry Record Store Day, everyone!",

Everyone had such a swell time at the musical blitzkrieg that they came down with colds. Their respective illnesses cannot dampen the colorful and illuminating memories that they made at SXSW 2014. For Bob, the band that blew him out of the water was a British jazz-punk group called Melt Yourself Down. Robin was impressed by Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl's band, The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger, because of their shift from sweet ditties to full-on rock. Stephen was surprised by the passion, force and energy from an instrumental, electronic group, Anamanaguchi. As much scheduling that goes into SXSW, our hosts often find that the best shows spread through word of mouth. So, they listened to recommendations and stumbled upon some fantastic gems. The airy soloist Vancouver Sleep Clinic was a notable gem, along with the Korean rock group Jambinai. To hear an array of nuanced sounds, hear the discussion. Also, don't forget to download The Austin 100 which will be available until April 2. Songs Featured On This Episode Artist: The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger Album: Midnight Sun Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl are back with bold, psychedelic-rock. The band's upcoming album Midnight Sun will be released April 29. \u00a0 Endless Fantasy Artist: Anamanaguchi Album: Endless Fantasy Hear a glorious chip-tune track by the New York-based band, Anamanaguchi. For more information, visit the band's website. \u00a0 Fix My Life Artist: Melt Yourself Down Album: Melt Yourself Down The London-based sextet melds jazz and punk sounds to create catchy, striking songs. For more, go to the band's website. \u00a0 Look Out, Look Out Artist: Perfume Genius Album: Learning Mike Hadreas, aka Perfume Genius, hails from Seattle and creates gorgeous, somber, piano-driven music. For more, go to his Facebook page. \u00a0 Rebirth Artist: Vancouver Sleep Clinic Album: Winter EP Tim Bettinson, who writes and records as Vancouver Sleep Clinic, is a 17-year-old artist who woos listeners with his high voice and impressive guitar segments. To hear more, go to his website. \u00a0 Hey Mami Artist: Sylvan Esso Album: Sylvan Esso The sounds of the duo known as Sylvan Esso are sleek, experimental and infectious. The North Carolina-based band will release their self-titled album on May 13. \u00a0 Leaving No Traces Artist: Highasakite Album: Silent Treatment This Five-piece Norwegian band makes music with a hint of pop, powerful vocals and booming percussion. Highasakite's upcoming album Silent Treatment will be released on April 8. \u00a0 Time of Extinction Artist: Jambinai Album: Difference This instrumental Korean rock band mixes high-pitched oddities with pummeling guitar segments. For updates and more, go to its Facebook page. \u00a0 Maidenhead Artist: Protomartyr Album: Under Color of Official Right This group from Detroit sounds like a garage rock version of Joy Division, with deadpan poetry and driving guitar noise.

Her phrasing is completely tied to her Welsh dialect \u2014 in fact, her first record was in Welsh. I find that that draws me into her songs: The enunciation is completely tied to the loneliness and the questioning. One song she sings at the Tiny Desk, from her brilliant album Mug Museum, is called \"Are You With Me Now?\" There is a feeling I love Buried in my brow I have no reason to run I see no reason Are you with me now? Listen to the inflection in the line 'Buried in my brow,' and then when she poses the question; it's so intimate, such a whisper, so inviting. I'm also a fan of her clean, sharp guitar playing and the way she weaves it together with her partner H. Hawkline. If you're a fan of Tom Verlaine and Television, you'll find yourself loving this lyrical guitar duo. It works so well stripped-down, though there wasn't much excess in the original versions to begin with. These are songs of essence, clarity and drive, executed so simply here.",

He recorded a new album, shelved the whole thing, and launched several other projects online, including an art gallery, mixtapes of his favorite songs, and \"Record Club,\" a series of cover albums performed by Beck and his friends. There was also 2012's Song Reader, an album's worth of new songs released as sheet music for others to perform and record. Beck's last studio release, 2008's Modern Guilt, was a sometimes driving, sometimes trippy rock record, with droning slow-burners and psychedelic guitar anthems. His new album, Morning Phase (out Feb. 25), occupies a different sonic space, one more closely aligned with 2002's Sea Change. That record was among the most distinctive in Beck's catalog: A downtempo, introspective and personal journey. While Morning Phase isn't a direct sequel to Sea Change, it shares many of the same themes and sounds: less space-funk and more lush ballads, with soaring orchestral parts. It was also recorded by the same group of musicians, including drummer Joey Waronker (Atoms For Peace, R.E.M.), guitarist Jason Falkner and keyboardist Robert Joseph Manning, Jr. Beck's father, composer David Richard Campbell, is back as well, providing string arrangements \u2014 which you can hear some of in the song \"Waking Light,\" premiered here.",

NPR has a large group of listeners with wildly varying tastes. But this year was even harder to call because we had an unusually large pool of contenders for Album Of The Year. In the end listeners picked Vampire Weekend's Modern Vampires Of The City as the year's best album. No other record came close. It drew more than twice as many votes as the next closest record, Arcade Fire's Reflektor. Daft Punk's Random Access Memories followed closely in third place, with The National's Trouble Will Find Me and Lorde's Pure Heroine wrapping up our top five. (You can see the others that made the final list below). Lorde led a trio of debut albums in the top ten, each fronted by female singers (the others were The Bones of What You Believe by CHVRCHES and Days Are Gone by HAIM). Listeners seemed less interested in let's-get-a-band-together guitar rock this year and more interested in studio efforts, like the carefully composed songs from bands such as Vampire Weekend or Atoms For Peace. There was a lot of love for dance and pop, with albums from Daft Punk, Janelle Monae and Justin Timberlake in the top 25. At No. 7, Kanye West's Yeezus was the lone hip-hop album to appear in the top 25 (you'll find more in the top 100 listener picks we list at the bottom of the page).

Also on the show: Death Cab For Cutie's Transatlanticism celebrates its 10th anniversary by releasing demo versions of every track from the record. It's a fascinating look at what would eventually become a revered album.

This time the group performs a sludgy cover of Hank Williams' \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.\" Plus surf-rock from La Luz, a new solo album from Rhye singer Milosh, and the band Swearin', fronted by Allison Crutchfield, the twin sister to Waxahatchee singer and songwriter Katie Crutchfield.

The theme of good vibes continues when artists that were featured on some of the earliest episodes of All Songs Considered, like TV On The Radio and Rokia Traore, return with new music. NPR Music's Lars Gotrich joins the discussion to explain post-metal in light of a new track from metal juggernauts Pelican. NPR Music intern Thor Slaughter brings the self-described \"#1 cut\" of Jackson and His Computerband. All that and more on this week's episode, and don't forget: \"You're the best, Bob.\" Million Miles Artist: TV On The Radio Album: Million Miles When they first emerged, we called TV On The Radio \"one of the most unique acts of the new decade.\" That would be the last decade. \"One of the first bands we ever featured on [All Songs Considered],\" Robin recalls. The longtime indie favorites have a full length in the works but are tiding us over with another one-off single, featuring a lush and dreamy sound. Tempest Artist: Lucius Album: Wildewoman \"The songs build in really potent ways,\" says Bob Boilen of this Brooklyn-based indie pop five piece. Maybe it's the dual lead vocals of Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig that give Lucius, which is quickly becoming a favorite, something extra. Deny the Absolute Artist: Pelican Album: Forever Becoming \"They came up at a time in metal where post-metal happened,\" says Lars Gotrich of Pelican. \"It was more melodic, resembling post-rock.\" The group, which has been around for 13 years, is readying a new album. Dead Living Things Artist: Jackson & His Computerband Album: Glow Glow is Jackson and His Computerband's second album, following Smash in 2005. \"It's glitchy, big and boisterous. It's a bit harder than most electro-pop out there,\" says Thor Slaughter. Tidal Ground Artist: Luray Album: The Wilder Taking the name of the Luray caverns in Virginia, banjo player Shannon Carey got help from her brother Sean Carey (Bon Iver) to produce this beautifully lush album. Kouma Artist: Rokia Traor\u00e9 Album: Beautiful Africa Another artist featured on an early episode of All Songs Considered. \"Kouma\" is the work of the amazingly talented Rokia Traore. An extremely accomplished guitar player as well as singer, Rokia released her new album Beautiful Africa in April.",

On this week's episode of All Songs Considered, with Bob Boilen on vacation (to hunt through the treasure trove of memorabilia in his basement), co-host Robin Hilton and NPR Music's Stephen Thompson attempt to fulfill their vision of a perfect bizarro world episode, with premieres from Cults, Minor Alps, Weed and more. One question remains: Can Bob really resist the temptation of trying to ruin Stephen's vision of a Bob-less show? Hear the show to find out. Weed Album: Deserve Song: Silent Partner \"I love the way the vocals are mixed behind the guitars; it gives it this really dreamy quality,\" says Robin Hilton of this fuzz-filled Vancouver four piece, which is currently readying its debut album, Deserve. The Julie Ruin Album: Run Fast Song: Ha Ha Ha Kathleen Hanna's (Bikini Kill, Le Tigre) new project is heavy on punk synths and shoutable and infectious choruses. Lily & Madeleine Album: Lily & Madeleine Song: Devil We Know \"This song is so pretty, it makes me wish I actually listened to this show more,\" says Stephen Thompson. This teenaged folk-duo (one member is still in high school) gained popularity after its videos caught fire on YouTube. Lily & Madeleine are preparing their self-titled full length for October. Minor Alps Album: Get There Song: Buried Plans Nada Surf's Matthew Caws teams up with Julia Hatfield to form the new group Minor Alps. The pairing brings out the softer side Nada Surf sometimes delved into while reaching for something new entirely. Cults Album: Static Song: I Can Hardly Make You Mine The duo known as Cults is back with its second album, Static, due in October. This track's gorgeous vocal hooks and retro production remind us of the band's breakthrough single \"Go Outside\" and we're excited to see how the album develops its classic sound. The Avett Brothers Album: Magpie And The Dandelion Song: Another Is Waiting \"Recorded close to the same time as their last album The Carpenter, Magpie And The Dandelion is in a similar vein,\" says Stephen Thompson of the soon-to-be-released album by The Avett Brothers. The group has one of the most die hard fan bases in modern music; from this new Rick Rubin-produced single, it's easy to see why. Kishi Bashi Album: Philosophize In It! Chemicalize With It! Song: Philosophize In It! Chemicalize With It! Released on a seven-inch for Kishi Bashi's upcoming tour, \"Philosophize In It! Chemicalize With It!\" contains the singer's big sounds and beautiful melodies.",

There's also new music from folk duo The Civil Wars, which finished its new album just before going on hiatus, and pianist singer Lucy Schwartz. NPR's Sami Yenigun plays a song by Moderat, the electronic group featuring the ambient sounds of Apparat and dance beats of Modeselektor, that amazed him so much he couldn't sleep. NPR Music's Jacob Ganz reveals listening secrets for productivity. Plus, the debate continues between Robin and Stephen Thompson about mix-tape etiquette. Who do you think is right? Typhoon Album: White Lighter Song: Young Fathers While the subject matter can sometimes be bleak \u2014 it's often inspired by songwriter Kyle Morton's health struggles as a child \u2014 Typhoon's music is always beautiful and uplifting. This Portland, Oregon band that sometimes includes up to 17 people is set to release their second full length album White Lighter on August 20th. Sebadoh Album: Defend Yourself Song: I Will The All Songs team has spent a lot of time this year talking about big comebacks from '90s artists and, more importantly, how all these releases have lived up to the hype. Now, after a fourteen year hiatus, Sebadoh returns with Defend Yourself, out September 19th. Our own First Listen series will feature the album a week before it's release. Moderat Album: II Song: This Time Moderat is collaboration between electronic dance music group Modeselektor and dark electronic pop artist Apparat. NPR's Sami Yenigun said of \"This Time\": \"I put it on to unwind after DJing. I like to calm down after the adrenaline of a show \u2014 this record did the opposite. I was wired after hearing it.\" F**k Buttons Album: Slow Focus Song: Red Wing NPR Music's Jacob Ganz says the music of this electronic production duo with epic rock leanings is motivational: \"I spent a lot of time as an editor reading copy and when this is on I feel like a superhero.\" Archers of Loaf Album: Icky Mettle Song: Wrong Brought in to discuss the ongoing feud over mix-tape etiquette that has been chronicled here and here in his advice column, The Good Listener, NPR Music's Stephen Thompson declared that Robin Hilton \u2014 who argues that one mix-tape deserves another \u2014 is in fact wrong, and picked this song for him: \"You are wrong, I dedicate this song to you, Robin Hilton. This is the Robin Hilton song.\" The Civil Wars Album: The Civil Wars Song: Dust To Dust Bob Boilen on the latest song from the now-on-a-break folk duo The Civil Wars, whose self-titled second album will be out on August 6: \"What I like most in this song is also the thing this pair of musicians does best, what Johnny Cash and June Carter did best: a conversation, a duet between two people with underpinnings of tension that add to and even confuse the meaning of the song.\" Lucy Schwartz Album: Timekeeper Song: Captain Sunshine Lucy Schwartz has had her music featured films and TV shows (including both Twilight and Shrek). On August 27, the Los Angeles, Calif. singer-songwriter will release her third album, Timekeeper.",

   "subtitle": "This week on All Songs Considered, Bob's so sure Robin will love a new song by the Australian rock band Pond that he lays down five dollars on the table. Then another challenge: Can Bob identify the collaborator on the new, mostly instrumental album by Arcade Fire violinist Sara Neufeld? Can you? Plus: Who made the right choice? Robin finally sees pop legend Paul McCartney, but Bob skips the show in favor of his monthly contra dance night. All that and new music from Okkervil River, Beck, Goldfrapp and more. Okkervil River Album: The Silver Gymnasium Song: Down Down The Deep River \"Down Down The Deep River,\" from Okkervil River's forthcoming album The Silver Gymnasium, is a beautiful, rocking song inspired by Meriden, N.H., where songwriter Will Sheff grew up. Also: Explore an interactive musical map of that small town, complete with stories and photos from Sheff's childhood. Beck Song: I Won't Be Long Beck is back and just as good as ever, with the gorgeously lush \"I Won't Be Long.\" The single is available digitally and (with a 15 minute extended version) on 12\" vinyl. Pond Album: Hobo Rocket Song: Giant Tortoise Bob Boilen is so sure that Robin will love \"Giant Tortoise,\" by this group that shares three members with fellow Australians Tame Impala that he throws five dollars down on the table as a bet. Once the guitar assault comes in, Robin is all smiles. Sarah Neufeld Album: Hero Brother Song: Forcelessness Can you guess who accompanies Arcade Fire violinist Sarah Neufeld on this song? Hint: He adds piano and records this song from two stereo mics in a parking garage. Goldfrapp Album: Tales Of Us Song: Drew It's been three years since Goldfrapp's last album, Head First. \"Drew,\" a new song from Tales of Us, out in September, shows a softer side than we've ever seen from the duo. It's a beautiful production on all counts. Light Heat Album: Light Heat Song: Are We Ever Satisfied? Light Heat is a new Philadelphia-based project from Quentin Stolzfus of Mazarin, backed on a new album by members of The Walkmen. \"Are We Ever Satisfied?\" is a lovely, rambling example of what he's been up to since Mazarin's 2005 album We're Already There. We still can't figure out what that squeaking noise on the chorus is.",

We had no clue at the time how serious the '90s revival would get. Ann Powers joins co-hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton, along with Stephen Thompson, to celebrate the '90s at their best, worst and weirdest, from the birth of grunge to the commercial rise of hip-hop, a batch of gutsy female songwriters and a few goofy one-hit wonders we'd mostly forgotten about, until now.

But before we do, we've still got a lot of great music from the first half of 2013 to share. On this week's All Songs Considered, hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton play new releases from some beloved artists who made some amazing records in the '90s, then went on extended breaks. Hear return singles from the power pop band Superchunk, Stephin Merritt's lyrical pop group Future Bible Heroes and Sean Nelson, former frontman for the Seattle rock band Harvey Danger. Also on the program: Great new psych-rock from the band Crocodiles; Pete Yorn's new Brit Pop-inspired band The Olms; glossy electronica from the Australian group Alpine; pipe organ pop from Anna Von Hausswolff; the strange new sounds of John Vanderslice and experimental rock artist Dirty Beaches; the ridiculously charming and sweet harmonies of the sister duo Lily & Madeleine; and an epic jam from the Lawrence, KS rock group Hospital Ships. Plus, hear the absurd (but so very true) story of how Bob injured his leg, and how he's getting around the new NPR offices without crutches.

Ferry has had a long and transformative career, beginning with his years in the rock group Roxy Music, to a solo career that's spanned forty years and fourteen albums. Though Ferry has long had a well-earned reputation for being a romantic crooner, he tells Bob \"it's always easier for me to write the sad songs and sing the sad songs. The moments I feel more creative are when I'm feeling introspective and maybe a bit sad. It's rather a lonely occupation, writing songs.\" Ferry recently released his innovative and completely surprising new album, The Jazz Age, which re-imagines classic Roxy Music tracks, as well as songs from Ferry's solo career, as 1920s-era instrumental jazz songs. On this edition of All Songs Considered, we'll hear a few of those songs, along with some of Ferry's personal (and sometimes heartbreaking) favorites, from artists such as Otis Redding, Aaron Neville, The Shirelles and Al Green. 1.

The rhythm is so intense and the way it mixes/clashes with all the electronic sounds is pretty thrilling. Thom Yorke pulled the group together to support his 2006 solo album The Eraser. It includes Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refosco (he's played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as well) and then drummer Joey Waronker, who has played with R.E.M., Elliott Smith and Beck. Now Atoms For Peace has its own record, called Amok, coming out at the end of February. This past summer, Thom, Nigel and Joey were in New York City. While they were there, we spoke to them from our studios in Washington, D.C., and now you can listen to that rather casual conversation about many matters, from how the group makes its music to why shy people are attracted to DJing.",

   "subtitle": "Every January for the past decade a dozen or more bands from around the world have gathered in New York City for globalFEST - one long, frenzied night of live music showcasing the diverse cultures, histories and numerous sonic branches of \"World Music.\" This year's lineup included Zimbabwe legend Oliver Mtukudzi and his band The Black Spirits, Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara, Chicago's wildly exuberant marching band Mucca Pazza, and much, much more. For this week's edition of All Songs Considered, NPR Music's Anastasia Tsioulcas, NPR contributor and Afropop.org senior editor Banning Eyre, and Rob Weisberg of WNYC (who also hosts WFMU'sTranspacific Sound Paradise) join Bob Boilen to revisit some of the highlights and favorite discoveries from this year's globalFEST. Oliver Mtukudzi and The Black Spirits GlobalFEST is generally a place to discover young new talent, but occasionally the producers welcome familiar friends to their party. This year, it was Zimbabwe's Oliver \"Tuku\" Mtukudzi, who has been an African musical icon since the late 1970s, who brought that sense of homecoming to GlobalFEST with his band, the Black Spirits. Kayhan Kalhor And Erdal Erzincan The soulful Persian classical virtuoso and composer Kayhan Kalhor has long been interested in creating artistic bridges to other musicians and styles. At this year's edition of globalFEST, he revived a partnership that initially began about a decade ago with a Turkish master artist, the baglama player Erdal Erzincan. La Santa Cecilia Based in Los Angeles and fronted by the smoky-voiced Marisol Hernandez, this fast-rising band splices and dices an array of Mexican and South American sounds in their songs, from Mexican norte\u00f1o and ranchera to Colombian cumbia. Christine Salem As the globalFEST evening wound down, much of the buzz about who was the biggest find of the year centered around a seemingly unlikely figure: the vocalist Christine Salem, who made her New York City debut in this performance. Fatoumata Diawara Undoubtedly one of the breakout stars of this year's edition of globalFEST, the Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara had the crowd wrapped around her finger. Gifted with enormous stage presence and great looks, Diawara put on a tightly choreographed set that screamed with energy and edged towards rock and funk. Mucca Pazza The circus came to globalFEST in the form of Chicago's Mucca Pazza, a group of 30 clowns who could barely be contained in the cavernous ballroom at Webster Hall. They wore mismatched, thrift-shop marching band getups and sported a full range of brass, drums, violin, accordion and electric guitar \u2014 plus a gaggle of nerdy cheerleaders. A Tribe Called Red The night ended with bumping beats down at Webster Hall's Studio space with the Ottowa-based Native collective called A Tribe Called Red. They call their style \"pow wow step\": an imaginative and dance floor-ready blend of beats, aboriginal singing and dancing, and visuals and audio samples that turn \"Indian\" stereotypes on their heads.",

Last week, when All Songs Considered posted its annual poll inviting people to pick their favorite albums of 2012, thousands of votes poured in from those listeners with sometimes surprising results. Babel, by Mumford & Sons, is the listener pick for the 2012 album of the year. It didn't come out until this fall, but managed to climb quickly as the favorite, at least among those who voted in our year-end poll. It's followed closely by Of Monsters And Men, Alabama Shakes, Jack White and Grizzly Bear in the top five. As you work your way through the rest of the most popular records you'll probably see a lot that you love, and you'll also likely find some that leave you scratching your head. That's the beauty of what happens when you have a large and wonderfully diverse group of voters with a broad range of tastes. On this week's All Songs Considered we countdown through the top 25 most popular records from our listener poll. 1. Babel Artist: Mumford & Sons Album: Babel 2.

New artists such as Kishi Bashi and Alt-J appeared with exciting and unusual records. Plenty of other surprises popped up along the way: Cat Power returned from a six-year hiatus with the best album she's ever made. Ty Segall, already a prolific artist, released three stellar garage-rock records in 2012 (three!), while the first-ever studio album from Macklemore, a rapper with little name recognition outside his native Seattle, made his debut at No. 1 on iTunes and No. 2 on Billboard. Meanwhile, R&B artists Miguel and Frank Ocean both released records that were unconventional but wildly popular. That's just some of the wonderful, unpredictable and endlessly fascinating music of 2012. On this edition of All Songs Considered, hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton chat with NPR Music critic Ann Powers and editor Stephen Thompson about the music that mattered most to them in 2012, including their favorite songs, favorite albums, biggest surprises and favorite new artists.

As the inventor of the Moog synthesizer, he gave rise to not only the technology needed for modern electronic music, but also the creative spirit that inspired countless musicians to take his vision and play with it, mold it and reshape it into mind-blowing works of art. This past weekend, a remarkably gifted group of electronic and experimental rock artists gathered in Asheville, N.C., for the annual Moogfest. All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen and NPR electronic and dance-music contributor Sami Yenigun were there and, on this week's show, discuss some of their favorite sets, including a special performance from electronic-music pioneer Morton Subotnick, Andy Stott, DJ legends Carl Craig and Richie Hawtin, along with Ana Sia, Squarepusher, Exitmusic and more. Morton Subotnick Subotnick released the first all-electronic album, Silver Apples of the Moon, in 1967. Last Friday, he returned to Moogfest 2012 in Asheville, N.C., to perform the whole thing live. Hear the performance in its entirety. Andy Stott Stott is known for deep, brooding techno tracks that are shrouded in fuzzy tones. Hailing from Manchester, U.K., the producer has released music both under his own name and as Andrea. Blondes This is the official video for the Blondes song \"Wine\" from the band's self-titled full-length debut. Ana Sia Ana Sia produces high-energy bass music set to hip-hop rhythms. Born in Minnesota, Sia saw her DJing career take off while in San Francisco, where her mix of low-end-heavy styles earned her a reputation for slaying the dance floor. Appropriately, her nickname is \"Princess Slay-ah.\" Death Grips Watch Death Grips perform at the CMJ Music Marathon via NPR Music and WNYC. This group from Sacramento, Calif., has given some of the most memorable live performances of any act this year, with bass-heavy beats and intensely physical theatrics. Squarepusher Note: Squarepusher's set at Moogfest 2012 was not among the shows NPR Music recorded. This track is \"303 Scopem Hard\" from Squarepusher's 2012 album Ufabulum, via KCRW. Richie Hawtin Hear Richie Hawtin's full performance at Moogfest 2012. Hawtin came up in the Detroit techno scene during the '90s, and built his reputation on a minimal style of dance music. It's not music for everyone, but those who follow any of Hawtin's numerous aliases do show with impassioned vigilance. Carl Craig This cut is \"Sketches, Pt. 4\" from Carl Craig's 2012 EP Last Decade, released under the alias Carls Davis. Disclosure Hear Disclosure's full performance at Moogfest 2012. Brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence grew up on the outskirts of London, and got their start in the U.K. garage scene making music as Disclosure. Ahleuchatistas This song is \"Mistaken Identity\" from the 2011 Ahleuchatistas album Location Location. Tim Hecker & Daniel Lopatin The song featured here is \"Uptown Psychedelia\" from Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin's album Instrumental Tourist, due out in November 2012. Exitmusic This performance of \"White Noise,\" from Exitmusic's 2012 album Passenger, comes via WFUV.",

As far as festivals go, it's one of the best for surprises, since so many of the acts are new and emerging talent. For the artists it's a chance to be seen and heard and, hopefully, loved. For the rabid music fan or journalist, it's a sometimes overwhelming embarrassment of musical-discovery riches. On this edition of All Songs Considered, recorded live at the Judson Memorial Church in New York City, host Bob Boilen talks with Thor Slaughter (yes, that's his real name), Music Director for KWVA radio in Eugene, Ore., and Emmy Black with Bar/None Records. The three share memories of this year's appropriately titled \"Music Marathon\" and talk about some of their favorite discoveries, including the trippy, psychedelic group Ghost Pal, the country-tinged garage rock band Turbo Fruits and the fantastically named duo Foxygen.

This year, tickets for the two-day event in Rhode Island disappeared a record three months in advance of the festival. It kicks off this Friday with full concerts by Wilco, Blitzen Trapper and Megafaun, and continues through the weekend with shows by Iron & Wine, Jackson Browne, Alabama Shakes, Conor Oberst and many more. On this edition of All Songs Considered, host Bob Boilen talks with festival producer, Jay Sweet about the extraordinary talent that makes the annual music celebration so special. This is the fifth year in a row NPR Music will be at the Newport Folk Festival to live webcast full concerts, along with WFUV, mvyradio, Folk Alley, and WUMB. You can see the full lineup of artists and watch live video from the festival at our Newport Folk page. This year Newport will celebrate what would have been the 100th birthday of Woody Guthrie. All Songs Considered shares music from some of the \"disciples\" of Guthrie: from Wilco to the supergroup, New Multitudes (consisting of Jay Farrar, Will Johnson, Anders Parker, and Jim James). But the festival is not only about paying tribute and traditional folk artists, but re-defining what folk means today.

   "subtitle": "When the NPR Music team started talking about the 25th anniversary of Paul Simon's Graceland, we soon realized everyone on staff agreed it was one of the all-time great records. That doesn't happen very often, especially in a group of people with such divergent tastes in music. Vote For The Albums Everyone Can Love This discovery got us thinking: Is it possible to form a top ten list of records everyone can agree on? The kinds of records that, if you put them on at a party, everyone would say, \"turn it up!\" So we need you to vote. We've started by nominating 20 albums that we think will be loved by everyone who listens to them, and we want you to tell us whether YOU feel that love. To keep this running through the summer, we'll need more suggestions for albums that might fit the bill. Keep voting, and by August we hope to have a final list we can agree on. A big quest like this one needs a big kickoff, so for this week's show Bob and Robin play a few selections they and the rest of the NPR Music team think everyone will love.

   "description": "When the NPR Music team started talking about the 25th anniversary of Paul Simon's Graceland, we soon realized everyone on staff agreed it was one of the all-time great records. That doesn't happen very often, especially in a group of people with such divergent tastes in music. Vote For The Albums Everyone Can Love This discovery got us thinking: Is it possible to form a top ten list of records everyone can agree on? The kinds of records that, if you put them on at a party, everyone would say, \"turn it up!\" So we need you to vote. We've started by nominating 20 albums that we think will be loved by everyone who listens to them, and we want you to tell us whether YOU feel that love. To keep this running through the summer, we'll need more suggestions for albums that might fit the bill. Keep voting, and by August we hope to have a final list we can agree on. A big quest like this one needs a big kickoff, so for this week's show Bob and Robin play a few selections they and the rest of the NPR Music team think everyone will love. Bob and Robin are also joined by folk singer Glen Hansard, who throws Bob Marley's Exodus into the ring. We don't even scratch the surface of the surface with this show. But we hope to get the discussion going by fitting in as much in as possible, from quiet, emotional folk, and psychedelic funk, to high-strutting, head-banging rock.

On this week's show, listeners dedicate songs to the ones they love. Hear music from\u00a0Bjork,The XX, a classic tango from\u00a0Carlos Gardel\u00a0and more. 1. The xx - VCR 2.

   "subtitle": "First Listen: Sharon Van Etten, 'Tramp' An interview with Sharon Van Etten with questions from NPR Music listener and Sharon fans. On her 2009 breakthrough Because I Was in Love, Sharon Van Etten is the embodiment of exposed nerves; the very essence of wounded vulnerability. In that record's best song, \"Much More Than That,\" she lays out her insecurities while laying herself bare: Adorned by little more than a chorus of her own looped voice, Van Etten tentatively recalls tiny romantic gestures as a way of expressing the inexpressible. \"One day I'll be a better writer,\" she sings at one point, as if laying out illustrative details in only a few words weren't already the hallmark of a gifted communicator. The albums which follow, 2010's epic and the new Tramp, stretch muscles and viscera over those raw nerves. Even when she's conveying disappointment, hurt or longing, Van Etten sounds more assertive and complex these days, aided by the ever-knottier contributions of guest players from The National, Wye Oak, Beirut and The Walkmen. The feathery coos of \"Much More Than That\" have given way to a tensely argumentative and conflicted sneer in \"Serpents,\" the remarkable first single from Tramp, out Feb. 7. When she sings, \"I had a thought that you would take me seriously,\" her words are smeared with accusation instead of apologies. She says it herself in the song's chorus: \"Everyone changes in time.\" By the time she gets to \"All I Can\" a few songs later, even her most defensive pronouncements \u2014 \"I do all I can / We all make mistakes\" \u2014 ring out with stormy grandiosity that sounds downright triumphant. To put it mildly, Van Etten wears those changes well. Evolving convincingly before the eyes of the world, she's now both a fearless balladeer and a blood-and-guts rocker, not to mention an increasingly vital and promising live performer. There's no artifice to Sharon Van Etten: With refreshing, unmistakable directness, she sings like a human being who wants more from herself. On Tramp, she finds what she's looking for.",

Instantly beloved releases by Bon Iver, Adele, Fleet Foxes, The Decemberists and others all made a predictably strong showing. Six months later, many of those albums have held their ground \u2014 but our poll of listeners' 100 favorite records from all of 2011 still had its surprises. The Black Keys swooped into the No. 6 slot with El Camino, an album just a few days older than the poll itself. Ceremonials, the follow-up to Florence + the Machine's sleeper hit Lungs, followed close behind. And it wasn't just the dark horses that stunned us \u2014 two of our personal favorites, the strong spring releases from Wye Oak and The Antlers, each dropped a dozen spots.

   "description": "This summer, when All Songs Considered asked listeners to vote for their favorite albums of the year so far, there were a handful of shoo-ins. Instantly beloved releases by Bon Iver, Adele, Fleet Foxes, The Decemberists and others all made a predictably strong showing. Six months later, many of those albums have held their ground \u2014 but our poll of listeners' 100 favorite records from all of 2011 still had its surprises. The Black Keys swooped into the No. 6 slot with El Camino, an album just a few days older than the poll itself. Ceremonials, the follow-up to Florence + the Machine's sleeper hit Lungs, followed close behind. And it wasn't just the dark horses that stunned us \u2014 two of our personal favorites, the strong spring releases from Wye Oak and The Antlers, each dropped a dozen spots. This week's episode includes songs from the top 25 listener picks. Once you've listened to the show, head to the All Songs blog for the full list of your 100 favorite albums of 2011.

   "subtitle": "If you were in New York City in the 1970s, you might have stumbled upon the birth of punk, new-wave, hip-hop, salsa, disco, minimalist classical and avant-garde jazz. The city during these five years \u2014 1973 through '77 \u2014 was the birthplace of many of the most innovative and influential musical genres born in the second half of the 20th Century, despite the fact that it was economically devastated, and was thought \u2014 at the time \u2014 to be musically bankrupt. Will Hermes was there. He was a teenager during the mid-'70s, and he's written a new book about that era called Love Goes to Buildings on Fire: Five Years in New York that Changed Music Forever. This week on All Songs Considered, Hermes tells Bob Boilen how a city plagued by crime and economic ruin fostered a booming arts scene, thanks in large part to cheap rent. And he spins some of the groundbreaking music that emerged during those years: a milestone composition by Steve Reich, an instrumental jam that became a classic hip-hop breakbeat, an extended dance cut that would be one of the first disco hits and the Talking Heads single that gives the book its name. Talking Heads Album: Love Goes To Building On Fire (1977 Single) Song: Love Goes to Building on Fire Incredible Bongo Band Album: Bongo RocSong: Apache Dinosaur (Arthur Russell) Album: Kiss Me Again (12\" Single) Song: Kiss Me Again Steve Reich Album: Music for 18 Musicians The Art Ensemble of Chicago Album: Nice Guys Song: 597-59 Television Song: Little Johnny Jewel",

They don't call it a marathon for nothing: For a band, performing in the festival can mean playing 10 shows in five days. For a fan, the choices of what to see are daunting and distant. Alabama Shakes might be playing on Delancey Street, while Teen is in Brooklyn and The Lonely Forest is playing KEXP's Showcase at the Ace Hotel, 20 minutes away. For music journalists, it's hard not to wish you could clone yourself to take it all in. In the end, the best way to have a rewarding CMJ experience might be to talk with a friend whose taste you trust. On this edition of All Songs Considered, Bob Boilen sits down with two New York journalists: Maura Johnston, music editor for The Village Voice, and Sydney Brownstone, a writer and videographer for The L Magazine.

Launch her collaborative iPad/iPhone application, and you'll see how this vision of music takes shape, literally. Here is the conversation we had in an office in New York City. And here are a few quotes of interest. \"I found in the touch screen a way to visualize how I see a song when I close my eyes.\" \"For me, this project's very much about solving things, solving riddles. I guess you could say that it is sort of about finding a new angle; how the electronic and acoustic could work together. How nature and technology could work together ... trying to find a fresh point where the listener and the music maker exchange music.\" \"A lot of the times on this project, him (Damian Taylor), me and my assistant James, we were in a house for a year in Puerto Rico. So we were basically waking up together, programming together, making music together, getting drunk together, swimming in the ocean. So it was a very good way to be totally immersed in the project. Then we were making pendulums out of buckets and string and rope and we ordered pipe-organ pipes, really cheap ones from eBay, and were plugging the touch screens to that. Basically, what we were making was coming out of those pipes.\" \"I found in the touch screen a way to visualize how I see a song when I close my eyes.\" So basically each app has a theme, a musicology theme, and this app (accompanying the song \"Crystalline\") is about structure. In the beginning, I thought I would make a music house in Iceland, a music museum for children so each song was a room. So you go to one room [and] you get to play with the lightning, you write a song; you go to another room, there are crystals there, and so on. That didn't happen. ... And then we thought maybe this is a 3D movie, and that may seem like a big jump, but actually for me, going from each song being a room to being a scene in a movie, isn't that much of a jump.\u00a0 You can use the tool of Western civilization and be impulsive and intuitive and emotional \u2014 and that, for me, creates a lot of hope.",

He got his start in the mid-'60s English roots- and country-rock group Kippington Lodge, which later changed its name to Brinsley Schwarz, and earned a cult following in the local pub scene for the band's laid-back, feel-good swagger. Later, as a solo artist, he wrote inspired songs full of wit and heartache, such as \"Cruel to Be Kind\" and \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding,\" a hit for Elvis Costello. Lowe also produced Costello's first five solo albums, including My Aim Is True and This Year's Model. Now, nearly 45 years after he released his first record, Lowe is back with his 13th solo album, The Old Magic. On this edition of All Songs Considered, Lowe joins host Bob Boilen to talk about The Old Magic and his long career making razor-sharp pop music. Lowe also shares some of the artists and songs he's loved over the years, from the country-boogie singer Tennessee Ernie Ford to a Conway Twitty-Loretta Lynn duet, as well as a rarely heard R&B tune from Jewel and the Rubies.
