Developer Tea is born out of my own desire to have shorter podcasts that come out more often. I very rarely have the time to listen to so many of the podcasts I'd like to listen to, because they are just simply too long. Developer Tea is engineered to fit inside your tea (or coffee, or kombucha) break.</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode, please consider <a href=\"http://www.developertea.com/buy-me-tea\">buying me some tea.</a></p>\n\n      <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DeveloperTea/~4/3zZXHweo77o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
