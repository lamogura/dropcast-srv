He beat the odds and now enjoys the status of a tenured professor at a major university, but he hasn't forgotten where he came from, or the racial realities that made his story so unlikely. George and I talked about his beginnings, becoming a philosopher and using his brand of \"down to earth\" philosophizing to explore the structure of blackness, whiteness and lived experience in a racialized society.",

His work draws on all the music he heard growing up in China and in the years since \u2013 from ancient ritual chants and folk songs to classical, rock and pop (both Chinese and western) \u2013 to create something that feels integral, vibrant and new. He\u2019s also a wonderful singer, as you\u2019ll hear in this very musical interview.

   "description": "It wasn\u2019t long after Einstein amazed the world with his theory of general relativity in 1915 that physicists were busily working out its more outlandish implications. And none freakier than the spacetime disruptions we now call black holes. Black holes have been making trouble for theorists ever since: putting ideas to the test, exposing gaps and contradictions, and forcing physics to search for new unifying principles beneath the rifts. The latest bit of black hole mischief is a set of paradoxes whose solution, some say, threatens one or more pillars of modern physics and may require a rethinking of general relativity itself.Cosmologist and relativist Anthony Aguirre, who so ably introduced us to GR in our two-part primer, returns to discuss the black hole information paradox and firewall hypothesis, which are fueling one of the hottest controversies in theoretical physics today. Anthony also provides an update on the BICEP2 experiment and the reported \u2013 now retracted \u2013 discovery of primordial gravity waves that created such a stir last year.",

Feminism, for example, was more than a push for equality and social justice; it was a wholesale re-evaluation of all sorts of unexamined \"truths\" about the world and the stories we tell. It\u2019s easy to underestimate how much the ground shifted back then, which is why I wanted to talk to Helene Moglen. She was there for, and part of, the whole shebang. In this interview, Helene offered a very interesting look at her life, her times and work as a critic. Topics include: Faculty parties before and after the women's movement, what really happened at those consciousness raisings, and feminist readings of \"Frankenstein\" and \"Robinson Crusoe.",

MIT neuroscientist Sebastian Seung is proposing something even more Herculean: tracing the trillions of neuronal connections in the human brain, collectively known as the \"connectome.\" He believes the connectome may hold the key to understanding the brain and the self. That follows from connectionism\u2014the notion that learning, memory and personality are embedded in the brain\u2019s wiring. Like so much else in neuroscience, that\u2019s still hypothetical, and Sebastian is refreshingly candid about the limits of current understanding. We discussed what is and isn\u2019t known about the workings of neurons, how the brain\u2019s circuitry might encode information, the relevance of computer models, and artificial intelligence techniques that may help map the connectome. Also: the \"Jennifer Aniston neuron,\" whether or not to freeze your posthumous head, and the cautionary tale of the South Park underpants gnomes.",

We discuss sex in the colonial city, the great rat massacre, murder on the Rue Hue, Hanoi in the time of cholera, and some charming French postcards.",

   "description": "In the age of science, what\u2019s a philosopher to do? As physics, biology and other hard sciences advance, is philosophy left with only a few increasingly recherch\u00e9 questions? Nope, says philosopher Colin McGinn. McGinn argues that philosophy is a kind of science (though it could use some rebranding to that effect), and those other sciences would do well to pay it some mind. A dose of philosophy could help clear up many scientific confusions and save theorists from a mess of conceptual errors (homuncular fallacy, anyone?). Colin McGinn and I talk science vs. philosophy, different kinds of knowledge, the nature of objectivity, problems with the scientific study of consciousness, and his Campaign to Rename Philosophy (CRP), which he wrote about recently in the New York Times.",

Like so much else in neuroscience, that\u2019s still hypothetical, and Sebastian is refreshingly candid about the limits of current understanding.

One of the tools Nosek and colleagues have used to expose latent racial preferences and other forms of bias is a simple online test, the Implicit Association Test, or IAT.
