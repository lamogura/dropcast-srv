   "description": "<p>Ryan and Amy Green were\u00a0facing the unfaceable: their youngest son, Joel was diagnosed with terminal cancer after his first birthday. Producer Sruthi Pinnamaneni tells the story of how Ryan and Amy stumble onto an unlikely way of processing their experience fighting alongside Joel: they decide to turn it into a video game. In the end, they find themselves facing what might be, for a game designer or a parent, the hardest design problem ever.</p> <p>Correction: In the original audio we stated that the survival rate of childhood AT/RT cancer is 50% over five years. But studies suggest the survival rate is 50% over two years.\u00a0The audio has been updated to reflect this change.</p> <p>For an extended version of this story and a\u00a0bunch more incredible stories, go check out <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/\">Reply All</a>.</p> <p>Special thanks to Eilis O\u2019 Neill, Jon Hillman, and Josh Larson.

   "description": "You know the drill - all it takes is one sperm, one egg, and blammo - you got yourself a baby. Right? Well, in this episode, conception takes on a new form\u00a0- it\u2019s the sperm and the egg, plus: two wombs, four countries, and money. Lots of money.\u00a0 <p>At first, this is the story of an Israeli couple, two guys, who go to another continent to get themselves a baby - three, in fact - by hiring surrogates to carry the children for them. As we follow them on their journey, an earth shaking revelation shifts our focus from them, to the surrogate mothers. Unfolding in real time, as countries around the world consider bans on surrogacy, this episode looks at a relationship that manages to feel deeply affecting, and deeply uncomfortable, all at the same time.\u00a0</p> <p>Birthstory is a collaboration with the brilliant radio show and podcast Israel Story, created to\u00a0tell stories for, and about, Israel. <a href=\"http://en.israelstory.org/about_us/\">Go check \u2018em out!</a>\u00a0</p> <p>We unfortunately claimed that this is Israel Story's first English-language season.

As Amir says, they wanted to say \"a big thank you.\" These meetings between intended parents, surrogate, and new babies are a traditional part of the surrogacy process in India and Nepal, and we heard reports from the surrogates that they also look forward to them. These moments do not stigmatize, reveal the identity of, or endanger the surrogates. Tal and Amir provided the audio for this web extra.</p> <p></p>",

But as they let go of him, they made a decision that reverberated through a world that they never bothered to think about.

   "description": "<p>Ross McNutt has a superpower \u2014 he can zoom in on everyday life, then rewind and fast-forward to solve crimes in a shutter-flash. But should he?</p> <p class=\"p1\">In 2004,\u00a0when casualties in Iraq were rising due to roadside bombs, Ross McNutt and his team came up with an idea. With a small plane and a 44\u00a0mega-pixel camera, they\u00a0figured out how to watch\u00a0an entire city all at once, all day long. Whenever a bomb detonated, they\u00a0could zoom onto that spot and then, because this\u00a0eye in the sky had been there all along, they\u00a0could scroll back in time and see - literally see - who planted it. After the war, Ross McNutt retired from the airforce, and brought this technology\u00a0back home with him. Manoush Zomorodi and Alex Goldmark from the podcast \u201cNote to Self\u201d give us the low-down on Ross\u2019s unique brand of persistent surveillance, from Juarez, Mexico to Dayton, Ohio.\u00a0Then, once we realize what we can do, we wonder whether we should.</p> <p>Special thanks to Dan Tucker and George Schulz.</p> <p>More info:</p> Listen to Note to Self's episode on <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 9.5pt;\" href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/stingray-conspiracy-theory-daniel-rigmaiden-radiolab/\">surveillance coverage</a>. <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 9.5pt;\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/new-surveillance-technology-can-track-everyone-in-an-area-for-several-hours-at-a-time/2014/02/05/82f1556e-876f-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html\">\"New surveillance technology can track everyone in an area for several hours at a time,\"</a> from the Washington Post <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 9.5pt;\" href=\"http://cironline.org/reports/hollywood-style-surveillance-technology-inches-closer-reality-6228\">\"Hollywood-style surveillance technology inches closer to reality,\"</a> from the Center of Investigative Reporting Ross McNutt's company <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 9.5pt;\" href=\"http://www.pss-1.com/\">Persistent Surveillance Systems</a>",

Karen was shocked ... and\u00a0then immediately\u00a0obsessed. So she spoke with\u00a0historians, dug through the National Archives and oral histories, and uncovered the astonishing story of a small town in Alabama overwhelmed by thousands\u00a0of German prisoners of war.\u00a0 Along the way, she discovered that a very fundamental question\u00a0 - one that we are struggling with today\u00a0 -\u00a0 was playing out seventy\u00a0years ago in hundreds of towns across America: When your enemy is at your mercy, how should you treat them?

   "description": "Today, we tackle football. It\u2019s the most popular sport in the US, shining a sometimes harsh light on so much of what we have been, what we are, and what we hope to be. Savage, creative, brutal and balletic, whether you love it or loathe it \u2026 it\u2019s a touchstone of the American identity. <p>Along with conflicted parents and players and coaches who aren\u2019t sure if the game will survive, we take a deep dive into the surprising history of how the game came to be. At the end of the 19th century, football is a nascent and nasty sport.\u00a0The sons of the most powerful men in the country are literally\u00a0knocking themselves out to win\u00a0these\u00a0gladiatorial battles. But then the Carlisle Indian School, formed in 1879 to assimilate the children and grandchildren of the Native American men who fought the final Plains Wars, fields the most American team of all. The kids at Carlisle took the field to face off against a new world that was destroying theirs, and along the way, they changed the fundamentals of football forever.\u00a0</p> Correction: An earlier version of this episode included a few errors that we have corrected. We've also added one new piece of information.\u00a0 The piece originally stated that British football had no referees. \u00a0While this was true in the earliest days of British football, they were eventually added. We stated that referees were added to American football in response to Pop Warner. American referees existed prior to Pop Warner, in order to address brutality as well as the kind of rule-bending that Pop Warner specialized in. Chuck Klosterman said that the three most popular sports in the US are football, college football and major league baseball. In fact, baseball actually ranks 2nd, college football is third. Monet Edwards stated that 33 members of her family were players in the NFL. That number is actually 13.\u00a0 We also added one new fact: over 200 students at The Carlisle Indian School died of malnutrition, poor health or distress from homesickness.\u00a0<br /><br /> The audio has been adjusted to reflect these corrections.",

Also the upcoming episode, which focuses on how categories affect us all, will explore in more depth the changes in Paige's life over the two years that she and Alix have spoken and will do that, as always, with attention to bi-gender and transgender reporting guidelines.\" Former Radiolab producer Lulu Miller and NPR reporter Alix Spiegel come to the studio to give us a sneak peak of their new show,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/\">Invisibilia</a>. <p>Invisibilia has an upcoming episode about categories, so Alix tells us a story about two very basic categories: boy and girl.

So today we celebrate with some classic Krulwich radio and a backwards peek into the spirit and sensibility that, in many ways, drives our show.</p> <p>For his birthday surprise we all listened to some old NPR pieces that Robert did in the 70s, 80s and early 90s \u2014 a news piece on the dawn of the ATM, a fake opera on interest rates, and the story of a family business splintered into relatives fighting to be first in the phone book. Along the way, we hear some incredible stories from Robert\u2019s life \u2026\u00a0</p> <p>And, just to celebrate the man whose infectious curiosity draws so many people (including us) to his side \u2026 we share with you the kind of gonzo, full-throated Krulwich story we usually can\u2019t include in the show \u2026 an epic of secret zoos, sewing machines, an alligator farm, a marching band, and a bus full of French tourists that save the day.</p>",

Maybe.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Sally Adee, an editor at New Scientist, was at a conference for DARPA - The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - when she heard about a way to speed up learning with something\u00a0called trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A couple years later, Sally\u00a0found herself\u00a0weilding\u00a0an M4 assualt rifle, picking off enemy combatants with a battery wired to her temple. Of course, it was a simulation,\u00a0but Sally's sniper skills made\u00a0producer Soren Wheeler wonder what we should think\u00a0of the\u00a0world of brain stimulation.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"p2\">In the last couple years, tDCS has been all over the news. Researchers claim that juicing the brain with\u00a0just 2 milliamps (think 9-volt battery) can help with everything from learning languages, to quitting smoking, to overcoming depression. We bring\u00a0Michael Weisend, neuroscientist at Wright State Research Institute, into the studio to tell us how it works\u00a0(Bonus: you get to hear Jad get his brain zapped). Peter Reiner and Nick Fitz of the University of British Columbia help us think through the consequences of a world where anyone with 20 dollars and access to Radioshack can make their own brain zapper. And finally, Sally tells us about the unexpected after-effects of a day of super-charged sniper training and makes us wonder about world where you can order up a state of mind.</p> <p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p> <p class=\"p2\">Special thanks for the music of\u00a0<a href=\"http://ghosttrainorchestra.com/\">Brian Carpenter's Ghost Train Orchestra</a></p> <p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>",

Then Lee takes us on a journey to answer a somewhat smaller question: how did that child die? Along the way, we visit Dr. Bernhard Zipfel at Wits University in Johannesburg to actually hold the skull itself.</p> <p style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><br /></p> <p style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">We wanted to give you a chance to hold the skull, too.

If you visit <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:332463\">our page on Thingiverse</a>, you\u2019ll see the results. Anyone with access to a 3D printer can print their own copy of the skull.

You can visit them to see the 3D printed skull, along with the other wonderful things in their collection: mosquitoes swatted mid-bite, toothpaste tubes from around the world, and much more.</p> <p style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><br /></p> <p style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to JP Brown, Emily Graslie and Robert Martin at the Field Museum in Chicago for scanning the skull.
