   "description": "For ages, developers have had the difficult task of balancing the amount of explicit gameplay tutorials with the level of player discovery that is provided in their games. Many gamers have experienced the 'overbearing developer' who forces players to endure an hour-long training sequence, while other gamers have been left bewildered in a massive and evolving game world with seemingly no direction or answers. In this week's show, Obinna, Andrew, Zack, and Ryan discuss pros and cons to tutorials and ways in which some games deliver key game mechanics to players. The fellas have a fun round table discussion about the history and evolution of tutorials (or lack thereof) that hopefully encourages listeners to consider the many sides of game design and content delivery. We are super excited that you're tuning in this week and we hope that you enjoy the show!

Martin, Owner and operator of Mobacap, a company that specializes in providing motion capture services. James talks about a powerful, yet inexpensive mo cap suit by Noitom called Perception Neuron.

Does the functionality match the design?\u201d\nTypically, developers are drawn to testing their game modularly (system by system). However, there can be pitfalls when testing things so modularly and you can find yourself missing things that would otherwise not show up until you test the game in it\u2019s entirety.\nTesting in Game Development isn\u2019t quite the same as other development domains (i.e. Web development) in so that you can typically test a whole website automatically with things like Continuous Integration testing. This doesn\u2019t quite work in games as there are several other aspects and influences in a game (think, colliders, game objects in a scene, physics) that can\u2019t quite be as well controlled. So, physically testing your game is absolutely essential.\nRemember, \"small changes can have huge casualties\u201d in your game. Do not assume that moving a game object in a scene one pixel to the left will not cause any problems\u2026 playtest, playtest, playtest!\nIn most games, \u201cfun\u201d is the name of the game. Testing for fun is critically important.\n\u201cFail early and often.\u201d Get your game out there and in the hands of potential consumers (friends, family, etc) and get their feedback on \u2018fun\u2019 and \u2018functionality.\u2019\nPlaytesting is something that you should be doing from the very beginning of a project, not something that happens after you\u2019re \u2018done\u2019 with the game. Play testing can start as early as the prototype phase of a project.\nCheck out the Halo 5: The Sprint documentary about how they hired several Halo experts to playtest their latest game.\nPlaytesting Pro Tip: \u201cPut music/SFx in your game as a final polish step\u201d \u2014 or mute your speakers as it can, and probably will, become annoying.\nWe recommend visiting the Unity Forums to request for feedback on your game in progress. Share it. Test it!\nThere are key advantages of \u201cblind testing\u201d as opposed to \u201cguided tests\u201d. Blind testing is giving your game to someone without being there to facilitate the user\u2019s interaction with your game. This \u2018blind test\u2019 helps with honest and unrestricted reviews on your game by the tester. You can learn what you\u2019re doing right, what you\u2019re doing wrong, and maybe even get new ideas by play testing with others.\nThe Debug Log Facebook group (\u201cThe Debug Lounge\u201d) opens up their doors, inviting members to share their games with the community for play testing and feedback.\nOther interpretations of \u201cEat your own Dog Food\u201d is that you should build robust systems so that they can be reused in your current project and/or other/future projects. Emphasis on code reuse and object-oriented design.\nImage: Toine Rooijmans</p>",
